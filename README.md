# Coding--Assisstant-Copilot-
Project Purpose: Creating a Coding-Assistant Copilot extension on VScode 
## What is a Copilot?
 An AI copilot is a conversational interface that uses large language models (LLMs) to support users in various tasks and decision-making processes across multiple domains within an enterprise environment. By leveraging LLMs, AI copilots possess the capability to understand, analyze, and process vast amounts of data.<br>
 
AI copilots play a crucial role in enhancing productivity and efficiency by:
<li>Providing context-aware assistance: AI copilots can proactively respond to user needs based on contextual information, ensuring relevant and timely support during critical decision-making processes. 
</li>

<li>Automating mundane tasks: By taking charge of repetitive and time-consuming tasks, AI copilots allow users to focus their efforts on strategic and creative work, significantly boosting overall productivity. 
</li>

<li>Analyzing data: AI copilots can quickly process large amounts of information, identify patterns and trends, and present actionable insights to drive effective decision-making.
</li>

<li>Enabling seamless communication: AI copilots facilitate effective interactions with various stakeholders, including employees, customers, and vendors, streamlining communication processes and reducing delays or misunderstandings.</li>

<li>Unifying disparate systems: AI copilots can be the cohesive force connecting multiple platforms, tools, and software applications under one umbrella, ensuring data integrity, accessibility, and compatibility across the enterprise.</li>

We are specifically building a coding assistant co-pilot extension as our product which has to mainly fulfill three criterias-
<li>Code Generation</li>
<li>Autocompletion</li>
<li>Model Integration</li>
